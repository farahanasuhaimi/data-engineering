# üìå Data Warehousing & Data Architecture Checklist  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Business Context & Ownership**  
Understanding the business aspects ensures that the data strategy aligns with company goals.  

- [ ] **Identify Data Ownership**  
  - Who is responsible for maintaining and governing the data?  
  - Are there multiple stakeholders?  

- [ ] **Determine Business Process Support**  
  - What business operations depend on this data?  
  - How critical is this data to business functions?  

- [ ] **Review System & Data Documentation**  
  - Is there a central repository documenting the data sources?  
  - Are there clear descriptions of tables, fields, and relationships?  

- [ ] **Check Data Model & Data Catalog Availability**  
  - Does a data model exist? If not, should one be created?  
  - Is there a data catalog to track metadata, lineage, and definitions?

## **2Ô∏è‚É£ Extract & Load**  
The extraction strategy must balance efficiency and impact on source systems.  

- [ ] **Decide on Incremental vs. Full Loads**  
  - Incremental loads reduce load time but require change tracking.  
  - Full loads ensure completeness but can impact performance.  

- [ ] **Define Data Scope & Historical Requirements**  
  - How many years or months of historical data need to be extracted?  
  - Are there legal or compliance constraints on data retention?  

- [ ] **Estimate Expected Extract Size**  
  - What is the total size of the data to be moved?  
  - How frequently does the data need to be extracted?  

- [ ] **Assess Data Volume Limitations**  
  - Are there restrictions on query sizes or transfer bandwidth?  
  - Does the source system impose any limits on data extraction?  

- [ ] **Plan to Avoid Performance Impact on Source Systems**  
  - Can extracts be scheduled during off-peak hours?  
  - Is it possible to use database snapshots or replication instead?  

- [ ] **Ensure Proper Authentication & Authorization**  
  - Are access credentials securely managed?  
  - Does the system support token-based authentication, SSH keys, VPN, or IP whitelisting?

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Architecture & Technology Stack**  
Choosing the right storage and integration methods ensures scalability and reliability.  

- [ ] **Identify How Data is Stored**  
  - What database or storage solution is used? (SQL Server, Oracle, AWS, Azure, etc.)  
  - Is the storage optimized for analytics, transactional processing, or both?  

- [ ] **Determine Integration Capabilities**  
  - How will the data be transferred? (API, Kafka, File Extract, Direct DB, etc.)  
  - Are there existing ETL tools, or do we need to develop custom pipelines?  
  - Is real-time data streaming required, or will batch processing suffice?

## **üõ† Additional Considerations**
- [ ] **Security & Compliance**  
  - Is the data encrypted at rest and in transit?  
  - Are there data governance policies in place?  
- [ ] **Monitoring & Logging**  
  - How will we track data transfer failures or anomalies?  
  - Is there a system for logging extract, load, and transform events?  
- [ ] **Scalability & Future Growth**  
  - Can the architecture handle increased data volumes in the future?  
  - Is there a plan for optimizing query performance as data grows?
